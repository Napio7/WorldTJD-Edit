Description:

256 Furniture and Prop Prefabs! The meshes included in this pack are some of the best models that we made in 2022. They come from a variety of projects we worked on throughout the past year. There are beds, couches, chairs, tables, plants, vases, rugs and a ton more. Everything was originally made for VRChat worlds. All the models can be used in most types of projects, but the package was created using VCC and Unity 2019.4.31f1. Some prefabs include animations and udon scripts. Udon scripts allow users to open doors on the fridgerators and activate the beer taps.
